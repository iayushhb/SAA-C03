# AWS Well-Architected Framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you
make while building systems on AWS. Using the Framework helps you learn architectural best
practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
workloads in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures
against best practices and identify areas for improvement. 

### The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework : 

|Name|Description|
|------|---------|
|Operational excellence| The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.|
|Security|The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.|
|Reliability|The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.|
|Performance efficiency|The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.|
|Cost optimization|The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.|
|Sustainability|The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.|
